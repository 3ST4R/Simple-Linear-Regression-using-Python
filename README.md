# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-Python
This project shows how to implement Simple Linear Regression on "Salary_Data.csv", containing 1 independent feature and 1 dependent feature, using Python

The "Salary_Data.csv" contains 30 entries of people having "X" years of experience and "y" salary.

The "Linear_Reg.py" reads the dataset "Salary_Data.csv", splits the 2/3rd of the dataset into training set, and the rest into test set, runs the Linear Regressor to fit the training set and predict the test set outcomes, and visualising the training and test set results using "matplotlib" python library.
